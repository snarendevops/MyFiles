A library is a collection of build and release assets for an Azure DevOps project. Assets defined in a library can be used in multiple build and release pipelines of the project. The Library tab can be accessed directly in Azure Pipelines.


Variable groups store values and secrets that you might want to be passed into a YAML pipeline or make available across multiple pipelines. You can share and use variables groups in multiple pipelines in the same project.

Variables groups are protected resources. You can add approvals and checks to these variables and set pipeline permissions.

Secure files give you a way to store files that you can share across pipelines. Use the secure files library to store files such as:

signing certificates
Apple Provisioning Profiles
Android Keystore files
SSH keys
These files can be stored on the server without having to commit them to your repository.

The contents of the secure files are encrypted and can only be used when you consume them from a task. Secure files are a protected resource. You can add approvals and checks to them and set pipeline permissions. Secure files also can use the Library security model.
