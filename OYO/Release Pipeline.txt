Release Pipeline
A release pipeline is a conceptual process by which we take committed code into production. As such, a release pipeline can be as ephemeral or as real as we want to make it. The fundamental release pipeline from code change to production software. A means of triggering the pipeline to run.

Itâ€™s divided into 2 sections:

Artifacts
Stages
An artifact is a deployable component of your application. Azure Pipelines can deploy artifacts that are produced by a wide range of artifact sources, and stored in different types of artifact repositories.

And stages will include our deployment stages like - dev, test, and prod, etc.
