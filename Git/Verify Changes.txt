<<UnQuote>>  --- By using git diff modified file only can display but not the new file. Displays the data of local repository and modified inside the working repository.
NOTE:- git diff displays what is in staging area and working area.

<<UnQuote>>      ---- Here with git diff no changes but when check git status its showing some modified files and new files.
suppose if we want to know difference between inside the stage area and local repository then we need to use below command.
"git diff --staged"           ----By this new files too get display means "new file:   Test3.txt"

git diff
git diff "filename"           --------for specific file
"git diff --staged"           ----By this new files too get display means "new file:   Test3.txt" (its compares staging area with GIT repository)
git diff HEAD                 ----Compare working directory with repository. HEAD will get the details from last commit of repository
git diff --staged HEAD
git diff --staged HEAD "file name"
