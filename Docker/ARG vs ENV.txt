What is ARG ?
---------------------------------------
ARG instruction defines a variable that can be used to build a Docker image.
ARG values are not available after the image is built.
In the running container you can’t access the ARG variables.
Once ARG variable is defined in the Dockerfile, you can always override the values by passing command line argument as shown below
If you need to pass two variables using CMD line then you need to use --build-arg two times

docker build -t test --build-arg VARIABLE_1=7 --build-arg VAR_2=8 .

We can have multiple ARG instruction in the Dockerfile. 
ARG is the only instruction that can precede the FROM instruction in the Dockerfile.
Example of using ARG argument in the Dockerfile

FROM alpine:3.7
ARG VARIABLE_1=5
RUN echo $VARIABLE_1

---------------------------------------
What is ENV?
---------------------------------------
ENV is to provide default values for your future environment variables inside the container
We can’t change the ENV variable using command line argument directly
If we need to change the ENV variable using CMD line then we have to use ARG and place ARG variable in ENV variable
In the below Dockerfile, we have created two variables , one as ARG and one as ENV

Using ARG Value in ENV Variable
FROM alpine:3.7
ARG VARIABLE_1=5
ENV VARIABLE_2=$VARIABLE_1
RUN echo "print variable value:" $VARIABLE_1
RUN echo " print ENV variable : " $VARIABLE_2

Build the docker image directly
You will both variable having same values as defined for ARG variable
docker build .
